When Intelligence Meets Prose
</div>
<br>
TextFlow is an LLM-powered Integrated Writing Environment (IWE) for professional literary editing — just as Windsurf and Cursor bring cascaded AI assistance to code, TextFlow brings the same approach to prose.


### Who Is This For?

- **Writers** — working on novels and long-form fiction
- **Editors** — professional literary editing
- **Screenwriters** — screenplay and dramatic works
- **Authors** — any structured manuscript requiring consistency

TextFlow is a set of LLM tools for text editing. It is a convenient environment for working with manuscripts. It features a natural language chat interface for agent control, similar to Visual Studio Copilot or Cursor.

The system includes Story Bible, which automatically generates and maintains knowledge bases for characters, world-building, and timeline consistency. Every change goes through the Patch System, allowing you to review changes with a clear rationale for each change. Quality Metrics offers a quantitative assessment of the manuscript based on parameters such as clarity, tension, and pacing, while a complete version history with semantic versioning provides full rollback capability.

How it works. Type natural language commands: "Remove passive voice from Chapter 3" or "Make the dialogue more authentic. Agent understands context and manuscript structure. Get instant feedback and execution plans. Review changes before applying them.

**Examples:**
```
"Strengthen the opening hook"
"Add more sensory details to the forest scene"
"Check if Emma's character development is consistent"
"Improve pacing in the action sequence"
"Find all instances of telling instead of showing"
```

The AI agent operates through a chat interface and has access to several core functions: it can retrieve specific manuscript fragments with editing rules and Story Bible data, execute structured edit plans with patch validation, update the Story Bible with new information, and analyze the entire manuscript to build or refine the Story Bible. You simply send a request — for instance, “analyze character development” or “remove passive voice” — and the agent autonomously determines which tools to use, retrieving context, generating edits, and applying them where needed.

There are no mode switches or manual configurations — it’s a single intelligent system that understands your intent and performs the necessary operations. Just like Cursor or Windsurf handle multiple coding tasks through one unified assistant, this agent brings the same seamless workflow to literary editing.

## 🏗️ Cascade Architecture

### Why Cascade?

Traditional AI editors work like this:
```
User Request → AI Response → Done
```

TextFlow's cascade ensures quality:
```
Chat Command → Analyze → Generate → Validate → Report
```

### The Four-Stage Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Analyze & Plan
- Agent receives editing instruction via chat
- Calls `get_document_context` to retrieve text, rules, and memory
- Creates actionable TODO list with specific steps

#### Stage 2: Generate Patches
For each plan item, the agent generates:
```json
{
  "before_anchor": "context before target",
  "before_excerpt": "text to replace",
  "after_anchor": "context after target",
  "after_proposed": "new text",
  "rationale": "why this change improves the text"
}
```

#### Stage 3: Execute with Validation
Calls `execute_edit_plan` tool which runs:
- ✅ Anchor validation — ensures correct location
- ✅ Style checks — no new passive voice, minimal adverbs
- ✅ POV checks — maintains narrative consistency
- ✅ Metrics calculation — before/after quality scores

Only validated patches are applied.

#### Stage 4: Report
Agent presents results in chat:
- Natural language summary
- Comprehensive JSON report
- Applied patches with reasons
- Skipped patches with explanations
- Metrics comparison

### Benefits of Cascade Architecture

**🔍 Auditability** — Every change has rationale and validation trail

**🛡️ Safety** — Multi-layer checks prevent quality degradation

**📖 Transparency** — Users see exactly what changed and why

**⏮️ Revertibility** — All changes tracked in semantic version history

**🎯 Precision** — Anchor-based patches remain valid even during concurrent edits

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Google AI API key** ([get here](https://ai.google.dev/))
- **Safari browser** (recommended for best performance and compatibility)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KazKozDev/textflow.git
cd textflow
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

App opens at: `http://localhost:5173`

### Quick Start (macOS)

Double-click `Start.command` file — it will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Start dev server
- Open app in browser

---

### Inline Editing

Quick edits without patch review:

1. Select text
2. Press `Cmd+I` (or `Ctrl+I`)
3. Enter instruction
4. AI replaces instantly

### Semantic Search

Search by meaning, not just keywords:

- Search "betrayal" finds thematically related passages
- AI understands context and concepts

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript** — UI with strict typing
- **Vite** — build tool and dev server
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** — AI model with function calling
- **react-window** — virtualization for large documents
- **localStorage** — persistent state management

**No backend required** — fully client-side application.
